You are supposed to enter data in an expected format.

<br>

Client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! **Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side**, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server
<br><br>

- validation done in the **browser** >> client-side validation

- validation done on the **server** >> server-side validation
  <br><br>

When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.
<br>

- if the information is **correctly** formatted >> app allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database

- if the information is **incorrectly** formatted >> app gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again

<br><br>

HTML5 form controls validate most user data without relying on JavaScript. This is done by using validation attributes on form elements.

- required
- min/max length
- min/max
- type
- pattern
- step
  <br>

[Validation related attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation#validation-related_attributes)

<br>

**Valid element**:

- matches the `:valid` CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style
- if the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so

<br>

**Invalid element**:

- matches the `:invalid` CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements
- if the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message

<br><br>

**Good practice**:

Indicate to the user when form fields are required (required by WCAG accessibility guidelines).

Only require users to input data you actually need.

**Character count feedback**:

Inn an accessible manner and let them edit their content down to size.
An example of this is the character limit seen on Twitter when tweeting. JavaScript, including [solutions using maxlength](https://github.com/mimo84/bootstrap-maxlength), can be used to provide this.

1: **Built-in HTML form validation**
<br>

- has better performance than JS
- not as customizable as JS validation
- browser-automated error message

<br><br>

`:invalid`

Can be “chained” with other pseudo-selectors: like `:focus` to only validate when the user is typing, `:before` or :after to generate icons or text to provide more user feedback, or attribute selectors like `input[value=""]` to only validate input fields containing content.

<br><br>

2: **JS form validation**
<br>

- control over the look and feel of native error messages
- to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation
  <br>

[Constraint validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation)

- `HTMLButtonElement` (represents a <button> element)

- `HTMLFieldSetElement` (represents a <fieldset> element)

- `HTMLInputElement` (represents an <input> element)

- `HTMLOutputElement` (represents an <output> element)

- `HTMLSelectElement` (represents a <select> element)

- `HTMLTextAreaElement` (represents a <textarea> element)

VALIDATION vs AUTHENTICATION

<br>

**AUTHENTICATION vs AUTHORIZATION**
<br><br>

**Authentication** is the process of verifying who someone is.

- works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user

- first step of a good identity and access management process

- visible to and partially changeable by the user
  <br><br>

**Example**: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.

<br>

**Authorization** is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

- determines what resources a user can access

- works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization

- always takes place after authentication

- isn’t visible to or changeable by the user.

<br><br>

**Example**: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.
